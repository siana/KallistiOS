/*

This module supports thread scheduling in KOS. The timer interrupt is used
to re-schedule the processor HZ times per second in pre-emptive mode.
This is a fairly simplistic scheduler, though it does employ some
standard advanced OS tactics like priority scheduling and semaphores.

Some of this code ought to look familiar to BSD-heads; I studied the
BSD kernel quite a bit to get some ideas on priorities, and I am
also using their queue library verbatim (sys/queue.h).
