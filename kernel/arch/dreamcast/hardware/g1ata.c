/*
   This file implements support for accessing devices over the G1 bus by the
   AT Attachment (aka ATA, PATA, or IDE) protocol. See, the GD-ROM drive is
   actually just an ATA device that implements a different packet command set
   than the normal ATAPI set. Not only that, but Sega left everything in the
   hardware to actually support two devices on the bus at a time. Thus, you can
   put together a very simple passthrough adapter to get a normal 40-pin IDE
   port to work with and hook up a hard drive to. In theory, you could also hook
   up various other devices including DVD drives, CD Burners, and the whole nine
   yards, but for now this just supports hard drives (and Compact Flash cards).

   The setup here is relatively simple, because we only have one channel which
   can have a maximum of two devices attached to it at a time. Normally the
   primary device would be the GD-ROM drive itself, so we're only actually
   concerned with the secondary device (use the normal cdrom_* functions to
   access the GD-ROM drive -- there's not a particularly compelling reason to
   support its odd packet interface here). Also, at the moment, only PIO
   transfers are supported. I'll look into DMA at some point in the future.

   There are a few potentially useful outward facing functions here, but most of
   the time all you'll need here is the function to get a block device for a
   given partition. The individual block read/write functions are all public as
   well, in case you have a reason to want to use them directly. Just keep in
   mind that all block numbers in those are absolute (i.e, not offset by any
   partition boundaries or whatnot).

   If you want to learn more about ATA, look around the internet for the
   AT Attachment - 8 ATA/ATAPI Command Set document. That's where most of the
   fun stuff in here comes from. Register locations and such were derived from
   a couple of different sources, including Quzar's GDINFO program, my own SPI
   CD Player program (which I should eventually release), and the source code to
   the emulator NullDC. Also, various postings at OSDev were quite useful in 
   working some of this out.

   Anyway, that's enough for this wall of text...
