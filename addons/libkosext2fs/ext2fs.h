/* Logarithm (base 2) of the maximum number of entries in the inode cache.
   Thus, the inode cache will take up (2^n) * 128 bytes of total space in RAM.
   Set this to a larger number to ensure you can have a lot of files open at
   once. Also, note that this is a global cache, regardless of how many
   filesystems you actually have mounted. */

/* Logarithm (base 2) of the number of head nodes in the inode hash table. The
   larger this is, the more entries the root array for the inode hash table will
   have, and thus the lower the probability of collisions in the table. Each
   entry in the array is a list, so collisions aren't fatal or anything like
   that. Setting this to something larger than EXT2_LOG_MAX_INODES is somewhat
   silly. I suggest either setting it the same or slightly less than the above
   constant. */

/* Size of the block cache, in filesystem blocks. When reading from the
   filesystem, all data is read in block-sized units. The size of a block can
   generally range from 1024 bytes to 4096 bytes, and is dependent on the
   parameters the filesystem was formatted with. Increasing this value should
   ensure that more accesses can be handled by the cache, but also increases the
   latency at which data is written back to the block device itself. Setting
   this to 32 should work well enough, but if you have more memory to spare,
   feel free to set it larger.

   Note that this is a default value for filesystems initialized/mounted with
   ext2_fs_init(). If you wish to specify your own value that differs from this
   one, you can do so with the ext2_fs_init_ex() function.
