/** \file   ppp/ppp.h
    \brief  PPP interface for network communications.

    This file defines the API provided by libppp to interact with the PPP stack.
    PPP is a network communication protocol used to establish a direct link
    between two peers. It is most commonly used as the data link layer protocol
    for dialup internet access, but can also be potentially used on broadband
    connections (PPP over Ethernet or PPPoE) or on a direct serial line to
    a computer.

    The API presented by this library is designed to be extensible to whatever
    devices you might want to use it with, and was designed to integrate fairly
    simply into the rest of KOS' network stack.
